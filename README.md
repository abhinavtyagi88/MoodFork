# MoodFork

# Problem Statement :
  In our fast-paced lives, mood swings and stress have become everyday experiences. People often reach for food as a source of comfort, but what if we could take it a step further and use specific foods to actively influence our mood? Certain flavors are known to naturally support emotional states, from providing relaxation to enhancing energy. However, most people lack the time, resources, or knowledge to identify recipes that can genuinely impact their mood. This is where our project offers a solution: helping users make deliberate, mood-enhancing food choices to positively affect their well-being.

# Proposed Solution :
 Our project introduces a mood-based recipe recommendation tool, allowing users to select their current emotional state or the mood they’d like to achieve. We utilize the FlavorDB API, which connects particular flavors and molecules with their mood-altering properties. For instance, citrus flavors are invigorating, while ingredients like vanilla or chamomile promote calmness. By tapping into these insights, our platform suggests recipes that align with users’ emotional goals, creating a mindful, flavor-driven experience with each meal.
